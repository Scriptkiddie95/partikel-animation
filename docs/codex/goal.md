# System Hero Particle Animation Goal

This document outlines the vision for the particle animation used throughout the System Hero project.

The aim is to render each letter as particles on a canvas and transition them seamlessly into selectable DOM text. Absolute positions are calculated so that canvas and text overlap perfectly on any display or zoom level.
